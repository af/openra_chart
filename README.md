OpenRA Unit Chart
=================

A silly little visualization of [OpenRA](https://github.com/openra/openra) units,
using [d3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3).

[View it in action](http://af.github.io/openra_chart)


Playing with the code
---------------------

Javascript is bundled together with Browserify, and css is built from Stylus.
You can use `npm run build_js` and `npm run build_css`, respectively, or you
can use [shamus](https://github.com/af/shamus) to run them automatically as you
edit files.


Note on branches
----------------

The master branch contains the latest code, the gh-pages branch also includes
the built css/js files that are served through github pages.
